LiSE is both a library and a standalone application for developing life simulation games.

# What is a life simulation game?

For the purposes of LiSE, it is any game where you are primarily concerned with "who you are" rather than "what you're doing". Everything your character in a life simulator can do should be represented somehow, but mostly in non-interactive form. This frees the player to attend to the high-level tasks of "living" in the game world: choosing what to do and when, rather than how.

In concrete terms, LiSE-style life simulators are games of time and resource management. The primary method for interacting with the game is to arrange events on a schedule, and then wait for your character(s) to carry them out. These games may be turn-based or real-time, but in the latter case, they allow the player to control the passage of game-time.
