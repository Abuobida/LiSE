# What is a life simulation game?

For the purposes of LiSE, it is any game where you are primarily
concerned with "who you are" rather than "what you're
doing". Nearly everything your character can do should be
represented in the game somehow, but mostly in non-interactive form. This frees
the player to attend to the high-level tasks of "living" in the game
world--which, in concrete terms, boil down to time and resource
management.

Existing games that LiSE seeks to imitate include:

* The Sims
* Redshirt
* Princess Maker
* Monster Rancher
* Dwarf Fortress
* Democracy
* Crusader Kings
* The King of Dragon Pass
* [Galimulator](https://snoddasmannen.itch.io/galimulator)
* [Vilmonic](https://bludgeonsoft.itch.io/)

# Why should I use LiSE for this purpose?

LiSE is a game engine in the sense of RPG Maker or Ren'Py. It assumes
that there are certain problems any designer of life simulators will
have, and provides powerful tools specialized to those
problems. Though you will still need to write some Python code for
your game, it should only be the code that describes how your game's
world works. If you don't want to worry about the data structure that
represents the world, LiSE gives you one that will work. If you don't
want to write a user interface, you can play the game in the IDE. And 
then again, if your game is similar enough to one that's been freely
released, you can import rules from that one, and not write that code
yourself, after all.

# Features

## Core

* *Object relational mapper* for graph based world models.
* *Journaling* to allow world state changes to be rewound and replayed.
* Integration with [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) for convenient access to various *graph algorithms*, particularly pathfinding.
* *Rules engine*: define your game's behavior in terms of actions that are performed in response to triggers. Change the connection from trigger to action without effort. Copy triggers and actions between games easily.
* Can be run as a *web server*, so that you can control LiSE and query its world state from any other game engine you please.

## IDE

* View and edit state graphs in a *drag-and-drop interface*.
* *Rewind time* and the interface will show you the state of the world back then.
* Code editor with syntax highlighting.
* *Rule constructor*: Build rules out of functions represented as cards. Looks like deckbuilding in a card game like Magic.
* *Autosave*. Actually, anything you do gets put in a transaction that gets committed when you quit. In any case you never need to save

# Getting started

```
# install the Kivy app framework
sudo apt-get install cython3 python3-dev python3-pip \
libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev \
libsdl2-ttf-dev
# ELiDE doesn't play movies, so disable gstreamer
USE_GSTREAMER=0 pip3 install --user kivy
# install LiSE and the ELiDE frontend
git clone https://github.com/LogicalDash/LiSE.git
cd LiSE
git submodule init
git submodule update
pip3 install --user allegedb/ LiSE/ ELiDE/
```

Thereafter you may run the graphical frontend as ``python3 -m ELiDE``. If you first run an example script, you can view the world it generated by running ELiDE in the same directory.

The allegedb, LiSE, and ELiDE source files are licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero Public License
version 3. If you make a game with it, you have to release any modifications you make to LiSE itself
under the AGPL, but this doesn't apply to your game code. Game code is that which is loaded into the
engine at launch time from modules specified by the following parameters to the LiSE engine:
* ``trigger``
* ``prereq``
* ``action``
* ``function``
* ``method`` 

If you write another application (not using any allegedb, LiSE, or ELiDE code)
that accesses a LiSE server via HTTP(S), it is separate from LiSE and not subject to its license.

In case of my death, I, Zachary Spector, wish for every allegedb, LiSE, texturestack, and ELiDE source file
to be relicensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/).
